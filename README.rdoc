== README for Toy App

A toy demo application to show off some of the power of Rails.

The purpose is to get a high-level overview of Ruby on Rails programming (and web development in general) by rapidly generating an application using scaffold generators, which create a large amount of functionality automatically. The resulting toy app will allow us to interact with it through its URLs, giving us insight into the structure of a Rails application, including a first example of the REST architecture favored by Rails.

The toy app will consist of users and their associated microposts (thus constituting a minimalist Twitter-style app).
